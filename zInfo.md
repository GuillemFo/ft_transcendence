the idea is to compile all from the Makefile (ill do it soon tm)

for now u can add your work to docker-compose.yaml services that will use the Dockerfile from /docker/backend/Dockerfile *example

and add your src at trancendence/back/src or whatever *example

Im building and destroying images a lot so be aware to branch all properly and push. (dont want to destroy anyone's work XD)

rn there is no network nor volumes between the dockers but if/ when needed just remember inception ;)

Ill use this file to update info, put important or useful links and more.

Useful commands:
- tree -> shows a tree of folders
- docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash -> exec bash in a container and enter to work


To do gforns:
- User tokens
- Tournament page
- Style register and login page for 320px (min-w-80) min wide 80
- lock max len of username and fix regex back and front.


As of 07.07 at 10.25am:
	multiple changes: general buttons, change dash to profile,
	added notes for tokens, implemented basic design for user
	profile...
	
	Discarted idea: 'Now ill try to work with a single main page
	and update all the code to it instead of rendering 
	everything all time. ill do new branch for it'
