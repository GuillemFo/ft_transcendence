# ft_transcendence

**ft_transcendence** is the last project of the **42 Common Core**.  
Its purpose is to bring together everything you’ve learned (**frontend, backend, networking, databases, DevOps, security, etc.**) into one full-stack web application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

At its core, the project is about:

- 🔐 **Authentication & User management** → sign up, login, 2FA, sessions  
- 👫 **Social features** → friends list, profiles, match status
- 🎮 **Game implementation** → real-time multiplayer game (Pong like)  
- 🌍 **SPA Web app** → smooth user experience without full page reloads  
- 🔌 **Real-time communication** → WebSockets for online status
- 🐳 **Deployment** → containerization with Docker / Docker Compose  
- 🏗 **Clean architecture** → separation of frontend & backend, modular code  

---

## 🎯 Goal

👉 The idea is: you don’t just build a game, you build an **entire online platform** where users can register, chat, invite friends, and play against each other — all in real-time, fully integrated.

> Built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **Vanilla TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS**.
